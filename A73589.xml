         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thoſe ſoldiers ſeemed to yeeld to their requeſt, but imparted it to <hi>Monſieur de Tremelet</hi> their Gouernor: who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what good might follow for the Kings ſeruice, together with the counſel of other Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors neere him, commaunded thoſe ſoldiers that had mooued it vnto him, to go forward with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Gauchet,</hi> (being the man on the <hi>Burgonians</hi> behalf that laid the plot). This <hi>Gauchet</hi> is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous ſoldier, yet within theſe ten yeres that he hath vſed warres, it hath been his fortune to attaine to the reputation of a Captaine, &amp; at this time ſerueth vnder the K. of <hi>spaine,</hi> although by birth either a Frenchman or a <hi>Lorraine.</hi> On this commandement of <hi>Tremelets</hi> the ſoldiers agreed with <hi>Gauchet</hi> both of the time, hower &amp; meanes, when and how they would deliuer the towne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of him ſome readie money, with promiſe of more vpon the obtaining the ſame. The time appointed was vpon Sunday night being the 3. of Auguſt, and Munday morning folowing. In the meane time <hi>Monſieur de Tremelet</hi> ſlept not,
<pb facs="tcp:173173:4"/>but ſent vnto the Gouernors of the townes about him for ſome of their ſoldiers to helpe in a caſe ſo needfull.

For <hi>Monſieur de Rumeſnil</hi> an old yet valiant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tooke the charge to lead the troopes of the neighbouring garriſons, and comming to <hi>sedan</hi> the 3. of Auguſt, departed in the Euening from thence towards <hi>Villefranche,</hi> ſending certayne footmen into the towne, and ambuſhed with the reſt of his foote and horſe about halfe a mile off, on the ſame ſide where <hi>Gauchet</hi> and his troops muſt paſſe. The ſigne giuen by the ſouldiers of <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franche</hi> vnto <hi>Gauchet,</hi> whereby hee ſhould know when to enter the towne, was a cannon ſhot: &amp; the like to <hi>Monſieur de Rumeſnil</hi> to iſſue out of his Ambuſcado. Now when the time drew on that the thing muſt bee effected, euerie man prepared himſelfe. <hi>Gauchet</hi> cauſed all his horſmen to a light a quarter of a mile from <hi>Villefranche,</hi> to conduct them vnto the Ditches, and from thence by the ſouldiers meanes into the towne. And <hi>Monſieur de Rumeſnil</hi> prepared to charge them behind. To conclude, the ſignes were giuen, and all <hi>Gauchets</hi> men that entred the towne or the ditches, were ſlaine or ſent flying into the ayre by certaine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of wild fire made for the ſame purpoſe,
<pb facs="tcp:173173:4"/>or drowned in the ditches. Mean while <hi>Gauchet</hi> that made haſt to folow thoſe that had entred the towne, was much amazed that he and his troops were charged behinde: and had it not been that one led his horſe after him (whether it were done by policie or good fortune it is not knowen) hee had likewiſe ſtaied behinde: but he got on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and ſaued himſelfe by flying. At this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw there was ſlain to the number of 300 and 120. taken priſoners. All the Leaders and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines except <hi>Gauchet</hi> were ſlaine, and all theyr horſes taken: ſo that of betweene fiue or ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men that the ſaid <hi>Gauchet</hi> broght thether, there eſcaped not aboue fiftie, which ſaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by the fauor of the night.
